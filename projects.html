        <h4><b>Two-Step Hierarchical Classification of Skin Lesions Using Transfer Learning and Machine Learning Techniques</b></h4>
        <p> This Project was implemented using ISIC2017 dataset, to classify the skin lesion categories such as benign, melanoma, and seborrheic keratosis. A hybrid model, 
        with a combination of Xception and Random Forest, achieved the maximum Balanced Multiclass Accuracy (BMA) score of 79%, outperforming the VGG16, InceptionResNetv2, 
        and DenseNet201 architectures</p>

        <p>This project was implemented for developing three binary classifiers with various feature selection and validation methods for classifying between Alzheimer disease 
        macro-stages, which are CTL, MCI, and AD. The dataset used contained both MRI and Gene expression features for various number of patients. 
        The final result was evaluated using AUC and MCC metrics.</p>

        <p>The project was aimed to implement ReGEC algorithm from scratch using R-programming language using different kernel types, such as linear and gaussian. 
        The performance was evaluated using 4 datasets, which are Cleveland Heart Disease, Pima Indians, Breast Cancer, and German Datasets. 
        The overall performance was significantly close or higher than the results reported in the paper.</p>

        <h4><b>A Comparative Study on the Automated Detection and Diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy</b></h4>
        <p>This project was based on a comparative study for the automated detection and diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). 
        Automated detection systems for DR diagnosis have proved to be a very helpful tool for eye care professionals. 
        In the last few years, the utilization of classification and segmentation methods has shown promising results in assessing 
        the retinal fundus images and facilitated the early diagnosis of DR disease. In this project, we analyzed the state-of-the-art methods 
        recently used for DR classification and segmentation in detail. Multiple machine learning, deep learning, ensemble learning, 
        and attention mechanism approaches were covered in this project. Also, we examined the research gaps in the DR domain and addressed 
        the critical challenges that require further investigation.</p>

        <h4><b>Detection of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Using Automated Tunable Q Wavelet Transform Technique with EEG Signals</b></h4>
        <p>This project was implemented to detect Parkinson's disease using an automated Tunable Q Wavelet
        transform (ATQWT) technique with EEG signals. EEG signals faithfully represent the changes that occur during
        Parkinson's disease in the brain. In our project, EEG signals were decomposed into multiple sub-bands (SBs) to get 
        detailed and representative information from them. ATQWT extracted representative SBs for analysis and provided better
        reconstruction for the synthesis of EEG signals by automatically selecting the tuning parameters. Five features were extracted from
        the SBs and classified different machine learning techniques. The proposed method yielded an accuracy of 96.13% and 97.65% 
        while the area under the curve of 97% and 98.56% for the classification of HC vs PD (OFF medication) and HC vs PD (ON medication) 
        using least square support vector machine, respectively.</p>

        <h4><b>Comparative Analysis of Eight Direction Sobel Edge Detection Algorithm for Brain Tumor MRI Images</b></h4>
        <p>This project was implemented to detect brain tumor from MRI images using eight directional Sobel Edge Detection algorithm. 
        Segmentation algorithm identified for detecting the tumor from the MRI brain scans need to detect shapeless tumor
        growth perfectly. In this research, Sobel algorithm with eight directional template was implemented for improving the
        detection of edges in brain tumor MRI images. The proposed algorithm was compared with other traditional
        edge detection algorithms. The performance of the proposed algorithm was analyzed in terms of MSE, RMSE,
        Entropy, SNR, and PSNR. Analysis shows that 8-Sobel is comparatively the most suitable technique for analyzing
        brain tumor MRI images. Active contouring segmentation algorithm was applied on the edge detected images to
        verify the classification accuracy of segmented tumor.</p>
