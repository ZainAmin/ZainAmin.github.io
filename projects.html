        <h4><b>Two-Step Hierarchical Classification of Skin Lesions Using Transfer Learning and Machine Learning Techniques</b></h4>
        <p> This Project was implemented using ISIC2017 dataset, to classify the skin lesion categories such as benign, melanoma, and seborrheic keratosis. A hybrid model, 
        with a combination of Xception and Random Forest, achieved the maximum Balanced Multiclass Accuracy (BMA) score of 79%, outperforming the VGG16, InceptionResNetv2, 
        and DenseNet201 architectures</p>

        <h4><b>Breast Mass Detection and Segmentation Using Multi-scale Morphological Sifting and K-Means Clustering</b></h4>
        <p>This project was implemented for mammographic mass detection and segmentation using a multi-scale morphological sifting approach integrated with a mean shift filter, 
        k-means, and post-processing that detects and segments masses. This implementation was evaluated on InBreast dataset and was able to segment mass lesions with a sensitivity 
        of 76.92%.</p>

        <h4><b>Alzheimer Disease Classification Using MRIs and Gene Expression Data</b></h4>
        <p>This project was implemented for developing three binary classifiers with various feature selection and validation methods for classifying between Alzheimer disease 
        macro-stages, which are CTL, MCI, and AD. The dataset used contained both MRI and Gene expression features for various number of patients. 
        The final result was evaluated using AUC and MCC metrics.</p>

        <p>The project was aimed to implement ReGEC algorithm from scratch using R-programming language using different kernel types, such as linear and gaussian. 
        The performance was evaluated using 4 datasets, which are Cleveland Heart Disease, Pima Indians, Breast Cancer, and German Datasets. 
        The overall performance was significantly close or higher than the results reported in the paper.</p>

        <h4><b>Detection of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Using Automated Tunable Q Wavelet Transform Technique with EEG Signals</b></h4>
        <p>This project was implemented to detect Parkinson's disease using an automated Tunable Q Wavelet
        transform (ATQWT) technique with EEG signals. EEG signals faithfully represent the changes that occur during
        Parkinson's disease in the brain. In our project, EEG signals were decomposed into multiple sub-bands (SBs) to get 
        detailed and representative information from them. ATQWT extracted representative SBs for analysis and provided better
        reconstruction for the synthesis of EEG signals by automatically selecting the tuning parameters. Five features were extracted from
        the SBs and classified different machine learning techniques. The proposed method yielded an accuracy of 96.13% and 97.65% 
        while the area under the curve of 97% and 98.56% for the classification of HC vs PD (OFF medication) and HC vs PD (ON medication) 
        using least square support vector machine, respectively.</p>
